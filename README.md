# Monte-Carlo-Algorithms
Implementation of Monte Carlo Algorithms on a minor scale
- Integrating a sample function sin(x) from 0 to pi and employing variance reduction techniques to optimize result
- Simulating the random motion of a molecule in a box a.k.a Random Walk and calculating squared mean distance
- Estimation of the value of pi by using random raindrops falling in a circle inscribed by a square
